                        <h4>Fly With the Wind</h4>
                        Original Composer: McCoy Tyner<br>
                        Arrangement/Transcription: Kamau Kenyatta<br>
                        <br>
                        I display this piece here for a few reasons. I feel that among
                        the many pieces I played as part of UC San Diego’s jazz
                        orchestra, this piece best displays both my technique and
                        personal style. I feel that on this piece, my personal style
                        was adapted the best; the original recording, while having
                        unique and impressive drumming itself, was very different from
                        the way I interpreted it, and i’m very happy with what my
                        personal style was able to bring. Additionally, I feel that
                        the rest of the band also performed very well, with special
                        kudos to the soloists.

                        <h4>Philosophy in a Teacup</h4>
                        Original Composer: Tsuneo Imahori<br>
                        Arrangment/Transcription: <a href="https://chasepado.bandcamp.com/">Chase Pado</a><br>
                        <br>
                        This was transcribed on my behalf by my friend and piano teacher,
                        Chase Pado (who plays on this piece, as well as on a few of the
                        other recordings on this page). It comes from one of my favorite
                        shows, “Trigun”, for which Tsuneo Imahori created a really
                        wonderful collection of pieces that combine folk, jazz, blues and
                        electronic (specifically jungle).<br>
                        <br>
                        Though i’ve played jazz drums for a long time, I’ve often felt not
                        part of jazz culture, at least not as much as many of the other
                        members of the bands i’ve played in. My personal listening time is
                        divided among many other types of music, especially those with
                        electronic and hip hop influences. As such, I’ve been really keen
                        on music that could possibly translated to and performed in a jazz
                        context; to introduce jazz players and listeners to more
                        contemporary sounds.<br>
                        <br>
                        I first heard philosophy in a teacup at a
                        time when I was getting into drum and bass, jungle, and breakcore
                        music, and so I became really enamored by the fusion between its
                        fast intense drum breaks and delicate jazz melodies. A pronounced
                        bass line that serves as a root or backbone is also something I’ve
                        found I appreciate in a lot of music.

                        <h4>Mode to John</h4>
                        Original Composer: McCoy Tyner<br>
                        Transcription/Arrangement: Kamau Kenyatta<br>
                        <br>
                        Mode to John for me was a pretty pivotal point for me in
                        my drumming. Up until this point, soloing was mostly a
                        difficult and embarrassing part of playing for me. I like drum
                        solos, and I really enjoy a good drum solo, especially if it
                        has interesting structure and dynamics, but I’ve never felt
                        that anything I did would be good enough. For whatever reason,
                        I was able to solo fluidly on this piece, and each time with
                        some subtle difference in practice. This song has a lot of
                        solos, not even just one, and I didn’t hate myself every time
                        I would play it, and that was a good feeling. I was even
                        getting praise and support from the rest of the band. When it
                        came to the actual performance, I put a lot of pressure on
                        myself to play this piece in the most impressive way possible,
                        and as a result I think I did not play this piece with as much
                        thought or fluidity as I had played it in rehearsal. When I
                        listen to the recording now, I feel I favored more blustering,
                        loud, fast fills over subtlety. Overall, I still liked the way
                        it came out, and proud of my accomplishment in playing it.<br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, speed swing was very difficult for me for a long
                        time, and though I did not have much time to practice drums in
                        college due to my engineering work, I was able to practice
                        consistent swung triplets whenever I had time, just patting my
                        lap. I think that shows through on this piece. Though the
                        tempo is relatively high, I can hear that I was much more able
                        to keep up the speed without sacrificing the full swing rhythm
                        on my right hand. In general, I like the way I was able to
                        incorporate various ghost notes and fills, as well as follow
                        the soloist.

                        <h4>Oliloque Valley</h4>
                        Original Composer: Herbie Hancock<br>
                        Transcription/Arrangment: Kamau Kenyatta<br>
                        <br>
                        I have many recordings from the 5 years I spent in UCSD’s jazz
                        group, but this piece stood out to me because of how clean it
                        sounded relative to the others, both in terms of my playing
                        and that of the other members. I also enjoy that it moves
                        between multiple styles. Most of the other pieces on this
                        page are heavy on speed, and density in terms of my playing,
                        but this piece has me playing much quieter, and with more
                        subtlety. I’m happy with my performance here in a
                        different way than I am with my playing on the other
                        pieces displayed here. For the other pieces, I chose
                        those which I felt framed my drumming the best (since
                        this is <b>my</b> portfolio) but I feel that this recording of
                        Oliloque Valley shows how my drumming frames the piece as
                        a whole best; how it blends in and works with the other
                        players, which is equal to if not exceeding style in
                        importance.

                        <h4>Animals</h4>
                        <b>Original Composer</b>: Bonobo (Simon Green)<br>
                        <b>Transcription/Arrangement</b>: Benjamin Genchel<br>
                        <br>
                        I’m very proud of this recording because it was such an effort
                        to transcribe the piece and direct the band. As a drummer, I
                        didn’t need to read music (only rhythm marks), or know any
                        theory, so everything I knew how to play on melodic
                        instruments was learned through tabs, by watching others play,
                        or by ear. Without that knowledge, it’s very difficult to
                        transcribe and lead. However, since playing in jazz band in
                        high school, I had wanted to take more ownership of my
                        musicianship by finding jazz style music that I liked and
                        introducing it to the band and playing it.<br>
                        <br>
                        I was introduced to Bonobo’s black sands album in 2011, and,
                        “Animals” really stood out to me. While the experience of
                        really enjoying a piece of music, or really art in general can
                        be expressed with beautiful metaphor, I think what I liked
                        about it was the rhythm the on the drums (I would characterize
                        it as, fast and funky with a lot of ghost notes, exactly my
                        style),  the ⅞ time signature, and the bold, repeating
                        bassline. All those elements made the piece really interesting
                        to me; additionally, I found out later that the majority of
                        the music was sampled and mixed electronically, giving it a
                        modern appeal.<br>
                        <br>
                        I would say that I started to transcribe this piece in the
                        fall of 2011, and it took all the way up until June of 2012 to
                        actually get it in a state ready to play. I started by
                        listening to the song over and over again until I could get
                        some of the chords out, but the chords I had heard were either
                        really simplistic, or mismatched in key. Kamau Kenyatta, the
                        band’s director, was able to help me figure out the real
                        chords in a quick listening session. After that was set,
                        transcribing all the parts and melodies into Sebelius took
                        about 4 months with my engineering classes and research
                        schedule.<br>
                        <br>
                        Because I was unfamiliar with transcribing, I used Sebelius’s
                        midi playback feature as a measure of correctness. As a
                        result, the first version of the chart used only 8th notes and
                        relied entirely on ties and rests to define note length.<br>
                        <br>
                        Getting this done and performed was a big step in my
                        confidence as a musician, and the first time that my melodic
                        skills were applied in a professional context. Unfortunately,
                        it would be the last for a while as my engineering curriculum
                        and projects began to take up more of my time, and I no longer
                        had room in my schedule to apply my below average transcribing
                        skills over a long period of time. I had hoped to follow this
                        piece with “Philosophy in a Teacup,” but I ended up waiting
                        until I could find another person to help me with the
                        transcription.<br>

                        <h4>Second</h4>
                        This is a work in progress piece written and produced by me
                        with help and guidance from my teacher, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/goodnightcody">Cody Farwell.</a>
                        <br><br>
                        I think this piece reflects heavily my desire to introduce
                        chaos and noise into my music. Though I'm not always in the mood,
                        I really appreciate music that attempts novelty, goes off the
                        beaten path, or suprises me. In that sense, I almost feel that
                        breaking down a song's melody and rhythm, introducing stabbing,
                        or startling noises that are disharmonious or arhythmic, is almost
                        the easy way of doing that. In that spirit, the intro jumps around
                        across several octaves, drops in and out, trading with the
                        percussion, and doesn't follow a particular meter. It then drops
                        into a lead melody that contains 3 bars of 4, giving an almost odd
                        meter feel.<br>
                        <br>
                        Like most of the music that I make, this started out with just
                        playing around with synths until I found a sound I liked. What
                        I came up with, which is part of what made it to the track, was
                        a gliding, modulated square and sine wave that sounded a bit like
                        R2D2 when moving from high to low. The robotic sounding lead led
                        me to attempt a piece in the style of
                        <a href="http://www.tomonojomiyagi.com/">Tomonojo Miyagi</a>,
                        a japanese artist that similarly incorporates a lot of static,
                        distortion and machine noise samples into his ambient styled
                        works.<br>
                        <br>
                        What came about between sessions with my teacher strayed from that
                        path a bit, though I'm not unhappy for how it's turning out.

                        <h4>First</h4>
                        This first song I worked on with my production teacher,
                        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/goodnightcody">Cody Farwell</a>.
                        As a result of being the first, it's served as a playground
                        for attempting and demonstrating production techniques with
                        composition applied as an afterthought between lessons.<br>
                        <br>
                        Even now with how far it's come, the result of it really
                        being a sort of trial track shows in it's overall structure,
                        which is that it doesn't really have much structure. It moves
                        from section to section, keeping similar musical themes, but without
                        too much regard for a particular direction or feel, though not
                        for lack of effort.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first section was made entirely by me, which I think shows
                        in it's style, which is much more akin to my tastes. It's
                        smooth and ambient, with wide chords and a bit odd in terms of rhythm.
                        What comes after is a result of different experiments that
                        lead it to a more mainstream electronic sound, with a softer
                        build up leading to a big, danceable drop.<br>
                        <br>
                        Suprisingly, my favorite section ended up being the bridge following the
                        drop, with it's syncopated purcussion and funky bassline.
                        For a while, that section served as a sort of graveyard for
                        concepts that didn't really fit in to the piece. I feel now
                        that that added more character.

                        <p>
                        <h4>Beginning</h4>
                        A short piece I wrote and produced as part of a beat Cypher
                        for UC San Diego's Producers and Remixers Organization.<br>
                        <br>
                        I don't have much to say on this piece in terms of structure
                        and concept; really it came about naturally, just from playing
                        around with a few samples.<br>
                        <br>
                        By far my favorite part is the lead, which is actually just a
                        flute sample that's had a few effects added to it, played as a
                        keyboard. I was taking jazz piano lessons at the time, and I
                        was really eager to try to apply what I had learned in those
                        lessons to production. As such, the lead is just that, a series
                        of jazzy chords. Actually, I first came up with the ending progression,
                        then came up with the main progression to accompany the background
                        synth. I'm really happy with how both came out; they contain so
                        much feeling (at least to me). The main progression seems like a
                        call to battle, with what follows sounding like a peaceful
                        reprieve. That the sound is derived from a wind instrument
                        certainly lends to that aesthetic; I've often imagined valkeries
                        in the sky singing and blowing their horns over a war waged on the
                        ground when listening to this piece.

                        <h4>Organized Sound</h4>
                        This piece was composed as a final project for my
                        Electronic Music History class at UC San Diego, from the 
                        derivative concept of a sound collage or timeline for the
                        history of electronic music, at least up until the 1960s.
                        It takes it's title from
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se">Edgar Varese's</a>
                        term for describing his own musical style.
                        Each section represents a different era in electronic music history,
                        beginning with noise instruments and concluding
                        with a reproduction of 'Bicycle Built for Two,', an homage
                        to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews"> Max Matthew's</a> 
                        work at Bell Labs in 1962.<br>
                        <br>
                        When taking this class, I had to make a large
                        leaps in terms of my artistic appreciation in order to
                        tolerate all of the crazy pieces we studied. It was difficult
                        but I do feel in retrospect that it opened me to greater meaning
                        in art, and especially in music. Up until that point, the most
                        abstract music I had listened to was freeform jazz, which was
                        really more of a joke to me than a form of music.<br>
                        <br>
                        Following suit from the course material, I tried to include a lot
                        of chaos, tension, randomness, and disharmony. Friends who were shown this
                        piece later mostly described it as crazy and scary. But perhaps
                        to ascribe those qualities to the source was only
                        my interpretation, and the true meaning in that material was lost
                        on me. I suppose in that case this piece can at the very least
                        serve as a lens through which to view abstract art in the way that
                        a student who doesn't understand sees it.<br>
                        </br>
                        The majority of the piece is comprised of samples, with only
                        the 'electronic sounds' portion using synths created in ableton,
                        though still interspersed with samples from one of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen">
                            Karlheinz Stockhausen's</a> works.<br>
                        <br>
                        This piece received acclaim from both my professor and TA's,
                        with each emailing me after the presentation to congratulate
                        me on it.

                        <p>
                            This is the first piece I ever produced using Ableton Live,
                            and really what I would consider my first production, since
                            my prior attempts were haphazardly thrown together using
                            demo software. As a result, this is the first piece where
                            I didn't just write notes down to be played in a sequencer,
                            but designed and controlled sounds and effects at a somewhat
                            fine grain. <br>
                            <br>
                            This piece was written/produced for an assignment given in my
                            electronic music history class. The assignment was very
                            simple, just record sounds and pitch them up and down.
                            I however, decided to showboat and so made a passion project
                            out of it. <br>
                            <br>
                            In line with the assignment, all the sounds sans
                            voice samples (taken from the audio for Goku's super saiyan 3
                            transformation from Akira Torriyama's DragonBall Z) were
                            sounds recorded from around my dorm using the microphone
                            on my years old hand-me-down HP laptop.<br>
                            <br>
                            The melody and key for the piece were inspired and provided
                            respectively by the fundemental frequencies and accompanying
                            harmonics from a recording of a giant fan being used to
                            mitigate the unpleasant scents coming from UCSD's sewers; a
                            true 'look on the bright side' situation. Other samples used
                            include me cracking my knuckles, slamming a desk drawer and,
                            hitting a pot with a wooden spoon.

                    It was my absolute pleasure to work as an engineer for
                    CleverPet through an internship in the summer of 2015 and year
                    working as a full time software engineer. My primary work and
                    responsibilty was ownership of the backend. I architected
                    and built the current running version of the backend API
                    in Python on the Google Cloud Platform, and continued to
                    maintain and expand it over time. Designing the backend
                    included modeling data for the client ecosystem (pets, owners,
                    devices), exposing routes for sending and recieving formatted
                    data, processing, and authentication. In addition, I wrote
                    and rewrote large sets of unit tests, implemented parallelized
                    load testing using Google Compute instances, and provided
                    several utility scripts for the rest of the team to interface
                    with the API and datastore.<br>

                    My team worked on developing a military grade voice recognition

                    applications such as a web app, VoIP, and mobile app (Android) to
                    demonstrate its wide ranging applicability. During my internship,
                    I primarily worked on three projects:

                    My primary project, and certainly the one that took the most time
                    and effort was building the android app. The project was initially
                    going to be passed on to a contractor, but I volunteered to help out
                    because I had taught myself some android the previous summer and
                    was interested in learning more. Eventually, I became wrapped
                    up in the work, and was making progress quickly enough for the team
                    to forgo the contractor and allow me to develop the project
                    independently. I finished a functioning app; it
                    allowed a user to train the system on their voice, choose various
                    settings, and set a rudimentary lock screen using the system.<br>

                    As the webmaster for my professional engineering fraternity, 
                    I proposed and led a team to develop an internal organizational webapp
                    in order to facilitate task completion and better organization
                    and flow of information through the active body.<br>
                    <br>
                    The idea sprouted from the organization's inefficient use of 
                    multiple technologies; when I began my tenure, information
                    was evenly distributed between a chaotic private forum, a
                    facebook group, various mobile chat apps and google docs.
                    Nothing appeared coherent, and members were constantly uniformed
                    in various ways though one could easily envision a space in
                    which all the needs those technologies filled were
                    satisfied and integrated in a coherent manner.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body">
                    Over two years, the project evolved in concept in technology.
                    When I began leading the project, my teamates and I (to a much
                    greater extent) had minimal experience with web development;
                    I had hoped we could all learn through working on it. What that
                    meant though, was that there was very little specific direction for progress.
                    I had thought that Php was still the language of the web, and
                    codecademy's course on the language further convinced me of that
                    notion. Further, I personally had little experience leading, and
                    no experience leading a software team. By the end of the first year,
                    we had some good ideas out, a few pivots, and a function login
                    screen.<br><br>

                    <p class="project-body">
                    Fortunately, at the end of the year, I was able to recruit the help
                    of a few senior members that acted as co leaders and helped to push
                    the project forward. We started from scratch with modern tools:
                    Node.js, Angular.js, Heroku, and PosgreSQL. We had
                    conceptual meetings and came up with a more concrete direction for
                    the app - a timeline centric social network built around a core
                    'event' data model that could be generalized to a wide range of
                    conceptual entities. In addition, we cleaned out inactive
                    members and brought on younger members that we could mentor and
                    who could continue the project after we had graduated. Mentorship,
                    and the creation of a base that could be used as a project and
                    teaching tool to boost the careers of younger members became 
                    a central goal of the project.

                    <p class="project-body">
                    As a team lead, I organized weekly meetings, attempted to
                    implement agile coding practices and worked to divide tasks
                    in a way that would give people room to learn and work in
                    areas they were interested in. I worked closely with my
                    co-leaders to choose appropriate technologies for development
                    and deployment, implement proper coding practices, and
                    drive development forward both in terms of defining direction
                    and contributing code. In addition, I served as designer and 
                    created mockups (seen here) to define the look and function
                    of various app componenets.

                    This <a href="https://puredata.info/">PureData</a>
                    patch was developed as a final project for my Computer
                    Music class at UC San Diego. As a drummer, I was interested
                    in attempting to synthesize drum sounds from scratch. Additionally,
                    through the course and through my attempts to produce music in
                    my free time, I came to realize how inspirational randomness 
                    was for me. I attempted to combine these ideas in this patch,
                    a drum machine with accompanying random bassline.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body">
                    I think this patch is cool because on its own it's able to
                    produce something akin to listenable music, and some of the
                    basslines that come out of just random assignment are mesmerizing.
                    Additionally, because the line is purely random, it forces me
                    to digest and build on music that doesn't adhere to a particular
                    timing or key.<br><br>

                    The snare, kick and high hat sound standard; they kind of
                    remind me of 8 bit instruments. The crash was the hardest to 
                    work on and also the instrument that sounds least like it "should".
                    The had read a small blurb on the internet saying that a crash sound
                    was made by having many frequencies decay at different rates, with
                    the high frequencies lasting much longer than the low frequencies.
                    In retrospect, I should have included many more frequencies, covering
                    the frequency space with much higher resolution. Though what 
                    I got was certainly not what I was looking for, I still found
                    the sound interesting enough to keep. To me, it sounds sort of like an
                    electronic version of hitting the inside of a piano with a long paddle.

                    In my little bits of spare time, I often find myself working
                    on practice questions for interviews or tutorials for things I
                    find interesting. I realized after some time that in working on
                    these types of things, I was generating a lot of potentially useful
                    code (as well as sample code to show to those who request it),
                    and since I almost singularly in Python I thought it
                    could be useful to compile those snippets into a library that
                    I could import for future projects. The 'bhglib' repo was started
                    with that intent. It is small now, and doesn't have to much in it,
                    but my hope is that it will keep growing as I keep coding both
                    in personal projects and academia/industry.<br>

                    In addition, I also have many many practice problems that I save
                    that aren't particularly generalizable (or at least, I haven't seen
                    how to generalize them yet) and so I've also began posting those
                    as a repo separate from the libary. I feel that it's good to keep a record
                    of all work done, as well as share solutions publicly for those
                    who might find them useful.

                    The above website was built with the help of the web development
                    team I headed during my time as webmaster for my professional
                    engineering fraternity. It was devloped and deployed using node.js + express
                    on Heroku with the <a href="http://jadelang.net/">Jade</a> templating
                    language. We implemented parallax on the front end, as well as
                    interfaced with the twitter API to provide recent engineering related
                    news from popular twitter accounts.

                    This personal website was built using html/css/javascript
                    and JQuery for animations and effects. It is deployed using
                    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. I hope to
                    restyle the page in the future and add more effects and controls, as
                    well as an interactive resume in place of the current document
                    display. I would also like to include a blog here.
