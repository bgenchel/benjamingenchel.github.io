                <p>
                    Student Debt Simulator 2100 is a game by <a href="https://twitter.com/yaygamedev">Sean Fisher</a>, 
                    developed by Fisher and <a href="https://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/">VGDev</a> at Georgia Tech during the Fall 2018 Semester. 
                </p>
                <blockquote><p>
                    Tuition costs have risen so high that you, a new Georgia Tech Freshman, can’t afford college. It’s
                    your task to sneak your way to the top of Neo Tech Tower to steal the last scholarship in this 3D
                    first-person stealth game.
                </p></blockquote>
                <p>
                    This game was inspired by Metal Gear Solid and similar early console stealth and shoot games. It
                    appeared natural to me and others on the team to implement the fight song as an action theme, which
                    is realized in "Georgia Tech Fight or Flight Theme". Though my intent was to write a main theme for
                    the game, many have felt it sounds more like final boss music. When the need arose for corny elevator music,
                    I felt it would be fitting and humerous to adapt the song once more.<br><br>
                    Most sound effects were created in Ableton by layering enveloped synths, the exceptions being the
                    gun shot sound, which is layered with the sound of snapping wood, and the picking up objects sounds
                    which were recorded at my desk using a <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/">Blue
                        Yeti</a> microphone.

                <p>
                Trouble on Beryl Isle is a game by <a href="http://sflanagan33.github.io/">Sean Flanagan</a>, 
                developed by Flangan and <a href="https://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/">VGDev</a> at Georgia Tech during the
                Spring 2018 Semester. 
                </p>
                <blockquote><p>
                    The annual Party in the Penthouse is the most exclusive event on Beryl Isle, and you weren’t cool
                    enough to get the invite … Play as Luke the Wolf, explore every nook and cranny of his island
                    hometown at your leisure, and discover spots he can tag to build up his reputation! Inspired by the
                    classics of the genre, Trouble on Beryl Isle is a feel-good, open-world 3D platformer, with fun
                    enemies to fight and a deep moveset to master.
                </p></blockquote>
                <p>
                    Beryl Isle borrows aesthetic elements from the "radicool" aesthetic of late 90s / early 2000's 
                    kids cartoons and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPrRel4FplY">tv commerials</a>, as well
                    as the art deco architecture of Miami, Florida. Working on this game was an exciting opportunity for
                    me, because I grew up on the cartoons and aesthetic channelled by the game, and so was able to
                    revisit and tribute the media I loved growing up. While creating the music, I took cues from the music 
                    of Hey! Arnold, Rugrats and more and combined them with aesthetic elements of 90s hip hop, funk and island. 
                    
                    Sound Effects, all created from scratch with Ableton operator, were designed fit the bright, 
                    child-like aesthetic of the game.

                <p>
                Pink Pointed Toed Shoes is a recorded autobiographical story written and performed by Cheryl Cofield for
                the Georgia Tech Transformative Narratives Project, for which I created accompanying music. 
                </p>
                <blockquote><p>
                    Cheryl tells the story of how a date almost turned tragic, until she remembered the women who came
                    before her and got the strength of Solomon in her arms.
                </p></blockquote>
                <p>
                When I first heard Cheryl's story, I was enthralled by what I saw as an artistically crafted contrast between 
                the innocent fairytale she had conjured in her mind and the horrible reality that had torn through it.
                Just before working on Cheryl's story, I had played the hit indie horror game, 
                <a href="https://ddlc.moe/">"Doki Doki Literature Club"</a>, and loved how the visuals and soundtrack
                used glitch and dissonance to evoke anxiety and fear in the player, accenting the contrast between the 
                surface level of the game with its true narrative. <br><br>
                
                I had gotten similar feelings from Cheryl's story in a narrative sense, and hoped to emphasize what I
                was hearing with my score. Towards that goal, I used heavily tropey music contrasted with dark, visceral
                sounds, glitching, and vocal samples conveying fear, violence, and anxiety.

                <p>
                 I composed and produced this short piece while interning in Taiwan during the summer of 2018. Though I
                 didn't create it with any specific intent, in retrospect, I would characterize it as a piece which most
                 prominently centers around playing with aspects of its component sounds. <br><br>
                 
                 I built the piece around a sound I developed with while experimenting with Ableton's operator - the repeating,
                 rhythmic bass and treble line that begins the song and plays until the transition. I enjoyed its
                 vocality, its bi-polarity, and its strange rhythm, which all came from the synth. When I added the
                 droning bass, I found that, despite being monophonic, could produce pleasant harmonies, and had a nice
                 glissando which emphasized the differences in the sound at different pitches. <br><br> 

                 As I continued to write, I felt more and more like it evoked the feeling of walking outside a space
                 ship, possibly inspired by my having recently seen "Interstellar" on a flight. I tried to emphasize
                 that perspective by adding in more noise, and background vocal sounds which I made unintelligble and
                 distorted to mimic sound coming over a radio. <br><br>

                 The ending section is modeled after a technique which Tennyson uses a lot - shifting a song to a
                 completely different sound aesthetic while maintaining its composition. It is meant to represent
                 returning inside the ship and receiving a media broadcast from earth. <br><br>

                    These two are short pieces I developed while briefly taking Ableton Live production lessons with 
                    Cody Farewell, an L.A. based musician who creates and performs as 
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/goodnightcody/">Goodnight Cody</a>. They both display several musical 
                    preferences of mine with respect to pop and electronic influenced music, such as lush pads, glitch, 
                    unusual harmony, 8-bit like sounds, and an emphasis on percussive rhythm.

                A short piece written and produced as part of a beat cypher for UC San Diego's 
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProducerOrg/">Producers and Remixers Organization (PRO)</a>. Each
                cypher participant was given a pack of four samples&mdash;a flute riff, hi hat loop, pad, and synth
                stab. I relied most heavily on the pad, which I experimented with until I created the bouncy ping-pong
                sound I used as a bass, and the flute, which I added effects to and played like a keyboard (with
                variable note decay). The result: a heavily electronic valkeyrie battle opera played over a
                relaxed hip hop beat.

                <p>
                    All songs in this playlist were recorded live at UCSD for the 95JC Class (Jazz Chamber Orchestra)
                    during my time as a drummer there. I feel Fly With The Wind,
                    Mode to John and Oliloqui Valley best display my drumming skill and style. Philosophy in a Teacup, a
                    song from the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigun">Trigun</a>, combines jungle beats
                    and other electronics with jazz, and is one of my favorite songs. It was transcribed at my request
                    by the very talented <a href="https://chasepado.bandcamp.com/">Chase Pado</a>. Animals was my first attempt at
                    transcribing, directing or arranging for a band, and was a fairly herculean effort for me at the
                    time since, as a drummer, I did not know how to read or write music. It is also a favorite song of
                    mine, and another example of combining electronics with Jazz.
