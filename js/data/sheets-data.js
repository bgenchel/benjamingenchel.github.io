                    my favorite artists. Their music is unbelievably detailed, making clever use of processed environment
                    sounds and stereo field to create lush soundscapes which frame beautiful harmonies and melodies.`,

                    `"You're Cute", one of their earlier works, was the first Tennyson song I heard; the solo has always stood out to me.`,
