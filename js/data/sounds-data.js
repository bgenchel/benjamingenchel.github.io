                        Tuition costs have risen so high that you, a new Georgia Tech Freshman, can’t afford college. It’s
                        your task to sneak your way to the top of Neo Tech Tower to steal the last scholarship in this 3D
                        first-person stealth game.

                    `This game was inspired by Metal Gear Solid and similar early console stealth and shoot games. It
                    appeared natural to me and others on the team to implement Georgia Tech's fight song as an action theme, 
                    which is realized in "Georgia Tech Fight or Flight Theme". Though my intent was to write a main theme for
                    the game, many have felt it sounds more like final boss music. When the need arose for corny elevator music,
                    I felt it would be fitting and humerous to adapt the song once more.`,
                    `Most sound effects were created in Ableton by layering enveloped synths, the exceptions being the
                    gun shot sound, which is layered with the sound of snapping wood, and the picking up objects sounds
                    which were recorded at my desk using a 
                    <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/">BlueYeti</a> microphone.`,

                        enough to get the invite … Play as Luke the Wolf, explore every nook and cranny of his island
                        hometown at your leisure, and discover spots he can tag to build up his reputation! Inspired by the
                        classics of the genre, Trouble on Beryl Isle is a feel-good, open-world 3D platformer, with fun
                        enemies to fight and a deep moveset to master.

                    as the art deco architecture of Miami, Florida. Working on this game was an exciting opportunity for
                    me, because I grew up on the cartoons and aesthetic channelled by the game, and so was able to
                    revisit and tribute the media I loved growing up. While creating the music, I took cues from the music 
                    of Hey! Arnold, Rugrats and more and combined them with aesthetic elements of 90s hip hop, funk and island.`,

                    the Georgia Tech Transformative Narratives Project, for which I created accompanying music.`,

                    `</p><blockquote><p>
                        Cheryl tells the story of how a date almost turned tragic, until she remembered the women who came
                        before her and got the strength of Solomon in her arms.
                    </p></blockquote><p>`,

                    `When I first heard Cheryl's story, I was enthralled by what I saw as an artistically crafted contrast between 
                    the innocent fairytale she had conjured in her mind and the horrible reality that had torn through it.
                    Just before working on Cheryl's story, I had played the hit indie horror game, 
                    <a href="https://ddlc.moe/">"Doki Doki Literature Club"</a>, and loved how the visuals and soundtrack
                    used glitch and dissonance to evoke anxiety and fear in the player, accenting the contrast between the 
                    surface level of the game with its true narrative.`,
                
                    `I had gotten similar feelings from Cheryl's story in a narrative sense, and hoped to emphasize what I
                    was hearing with my score. Towards that goal, I used heavily tropey music contrasted with dark, visceral
                    sounds, glitching, and vocal samples conveying fear, violence, and anxiety.`,

                    `I composed and produced this short piece while interning in Taiwan during the summer of 2018. Though I
                    didn't create it with any specific intent, in retrospect, I would characterize it as a piece which most
                    prominently centers around playing with aspects of its component sounds.`,
                     
                    `I built the piece around a sound I developed with while experimenting with Ableton's operator - the repeating,
                    rhythmic bass and treble line that begins the song and plays until the transition. I enjoyed its
                    vocality, its bi-polarity, and its strange rhythm, which all came from the synth. When I added the
                    droning bass, I found that, despite being monophonic, could produce pleasant harmonies, and had a nice
                    glissando which emphasized the differences in the sound at different pitches.`,

                    `As I continued to write, I felt more and more like it evoked the feeling of walking outside a space
                    ship, possibly inspired by my having recently seen "Interstellar" on a flight. I tried to emphasize
                    that perspective by adding in more noise, and background vocal sounds which I made unintelligble and
                    distorted to mimic sound coming over a radio.`,

                    `The ending section is modeled after a technique which Tennyson uses a lot - shifting a song to a
                    completely different sound aesthetic while maintaining its composition. It is meant to represent
                    returning inside the ship and receiving a media broadcast from earth.`
