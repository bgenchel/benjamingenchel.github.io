            Welcome to my personal site! I am Benjamin "Benjie" Genchel, a musician / engineer / researcher / composer / 
            data scientist / technologist originally from Los Angeles, California. I love to create and think creatively. I love to make things, whether its songs, programs, or hardware. I am interested in using
            machine learning and computational creativity research to gain a greater understanding of music, musical
            creativity and creativity in general. I am also interested in using this research to aid in the creation
            ion or enhancement of novel, artistic performances and experiences. I enjoy composing music, and developing interactive,
            musical hardware, installations and tools. 
            <br><br> 
            I am currently completing the final semester of my M.S. in Music Technology at the Georgia Institute of
            Technology, which I have attended since 2017. I conduct deep learning based symbolic music generation research 
            as part of the Music Informatics group under Dr. Alexander Lerch, and work on GrooveMachine, a physical musical sequencer
            installation as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Expressive Machinery lab under Dr. Jason Freeman,
            Dr. Brian Magerko, and Dr. Astrid Bin among a variety of other projects. Head to the 
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page or to my <a href="https://github.com/bgenchel">Github</a> 
            for more information. 
            <br><br>
            In 2015, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at UC San Diego, with focuses in machine learning and
            computer science and a minor in mathematics. While at UC San Diego, I played Drum Set in Jazz Chamber
            Orchestra under Kamau Kenyatta, performed service work in the highlands of Guatemala as part of
            Alternative Breaks, and accepted an invitation to join Eta Kappa Nu electrical and computer engineering
            honor society. I was also heavily involved as a member of the Theta Tau professional engineering
            fraternity, where I served as webmaster and pledge instructor.
            <br><br> 
            I have been performing and playing drum set for over 12 years, and self learning guitar and piano for around the same
            amount of time. Upon arrival in Atlanta, I began taking Jazz Piano lessons as a means of both satisying
            a personal desire (I love jazz piano), learning more about melody and harmony (knowledge not afforded by
            percussion) and supplementing my graduate education.
            <br><br>
            I have been sporadically composing and producing music in Ableton Live since 2010, a practice which has
            taken on increasing importance to me. During my time at Georgia Tech, I have contributed music and sound effects 
            to a number of student developed games, scored recorded stories for the <a href="https://sdie.gatech.edu/transformative-narratives">
                Transformative Narratives</a> project, and composed music to accompany school projects.
            <br><br>
            My other interests include animation, sustainability (I have been mostly vegan since 2015), rock
            climbing, travel and photography. The latter two of these is combined in this page's header. 
            <br><br>
